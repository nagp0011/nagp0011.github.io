            <h2><mark>"About Me"</mark></h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Tanvin Nagpal</strong>. I am from <i>Delhi,India</i>. It is the capital city of India.</p>
            <p>I completed my 12<sup>th</sup> last year. Now i am studying at Algonquin College, Ottawa doing Interactive Media Design. I am really excited to look forward in the course.
            Looking forward to enchance my skills and be independent in all aspects. I am creative and ambicious towards my future. Taking this big step to study in <strong>Canada</strong> has always been my dream and an important decision of my life and I am really excited to experience daily life challenging and face them by my own in the end that all matters. Staying away from home and family is sometimes a task but in the end it will all be worth it and will make them proud</p>
            <p>I have been passinate about many things in life since i was a kid. I prefer to do something or the other instead of doing nothing basically i try learning different things each day. I am a person who loves to face new challenging and never give up, I love to explore places and do activities like <em>scuba diving, hiking</em> and other adventurous things.</p>
            <p>Past two years have been a task for all of us because of Covid but it made us learn alot many thing like <i>patience,  be strong, caring</i> and all above to be strong enough to face everything.These were the days when we use to sit together with our family and pray to be safe and healthy. There were many times when we use to be sad and do not feel like doing anything but our family was always there to cheer up. We also learned how to study online, though it is not my cup of tea but we had no other option.</p>
